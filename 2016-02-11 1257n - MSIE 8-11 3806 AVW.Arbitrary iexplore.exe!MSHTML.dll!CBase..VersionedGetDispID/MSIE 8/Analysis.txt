1238m - MSIE 8 DOMImplementation.prototype.isPrototypeOf type confusion
=====================================

Synopsis
--------
Calling the isPrototypeOf method of the DOMImplementation interface as a
function results in type confusion where an object is assumed to implement
IUnknown when in fact it does not. The code attempts to call the Release method
of IUnknown through the vftable at offset 0, but the object has the static
value 002dc6c0 stored at this location. This mostly results in an access
violation but may be used to execute arbitrary code by allocating memory with
an attacker controlled value at this location.

Known affected software and attack vectors
------------------------------------------
  + MSIE 8

    An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted
    webpage. Disabling JavaScript should prevent an attacker from triggering the
    vulnerable code path.

Repro
-----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<script>
  x = DOMImplementation.prototype.isPrototypeOf;
  x();
</script>

Exploit
-------
No attempts were made to reverse the code and determine the root cause.

A few attempts were made to control the value at offset 0 of the object in
question, as well as get another object in its place with a different value at
this location, but both efforts were brief and unsuccessful.

No attempts were made to find a way to spray memory at address 002dc6c0 in order
to execute arbitrary code.
