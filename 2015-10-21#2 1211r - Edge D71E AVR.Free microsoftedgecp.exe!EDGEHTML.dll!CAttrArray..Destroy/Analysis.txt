1211r - Microsoft Edge EDGEHTML CAttrArray::Destroy Use-after-free
=====================================

Synopsis
--------
Specially crafted HTML can cause Microsoft Edge to continue to use memory
belonging to a CAttrArray after it has been freed.

Known affected software and attack vectors
------------------------------------------
  + Microsoft Edge 11.0.10240.16384

    An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted
    webpage. JavaScript is not necessarily required to trigger the issue.

Repro
-----
<x style="
  background-image: inherit;
  text-decoration: line-through;
  height: 0;
  width: 0;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  font: menu;">

Description
-----------
When an element is created and style properties are added, these are stored in 
a CAttrArray. The CAttrArray is initialy able to store 8 properties, if any
more properties need to be stored, it will allocate more memory, copy existing
properties and free the old memory. Adding a "font" style property as the
ninth such property causes Edge to continue to use the old memory after it
has been freed.

Exploit
-------
What little investigation I did appears to indicate that there is no way to
reallocate the freed memory before its reuse. It is therefore probably not
possible to exploit this issue that way. I did not investigate how the freed
memory is used by the code exactly, and I did not look into other methods to
exploit the issue.
